# Activity 11: Course Project Brainstorming

## Overview

It's time to start thinking about your **final course project**! This will be your opportunity to apply everything you've learned in CMPSC 100 to create something meaningful and interesting.

## Project Requirements (Preview)

Your final project will require:
- ✅ Working prototype (functional code)
- ✅ Documentation (README, code comments, design explanations)
- ✅ Oral walkthrough (present your code and explain design decisions)
- ✅ **Multiple classes (2+)** demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming
- ✅ **Multiple functions** showing modular design
- ✅ Choice of **hardware** (Pico 2 + sensors) OR **pure Python** implementation

### Project Scope Options

You have two paths:

**Option 1: Python + Hardware (Pico 2)**
- Shorter code requirements
- Must integrate physical sensors/components
- Focus on hardware-software integration
- Examples: Smart monitoring systems, interactive games, IoT devices

**Option 2: Pure Python (No Hardware)**
- More extensive code requirements
- Focus on software design and algorithms
- Must demonstrate complexity through logic and features
- Examples: Data analysis tools, games, simulations, utilities

### Team Options

- **Solo:** Work independently on your own idea
- **Team (2-3 students):** Collaborate with peers (higher expectations for scope and features)

## Your Task for Activity 11

For this activity, you need to **brainstorm and propose 3 different project ideas**. For each idea, you'll identify:

1. **Project title and description**
2. **Type:** Hardware-based or Python-only
3. **Required hardware** (if applicable)
4. **Team vs. Solo**
5. **Key features and OOP design**

## Submission Format

Create a file called `project_ideas.md` in the `writing/` folder with your three project proposals. Use the template below.

## Project Idea Inspiration

### Hardware-Based Project Ideas

1. **Smart Home Environment Monitor**
   - Monitor temperature, humidity, light, moisture (add at least one more sensor)
   - Alert system with LED indicators
   - Historical data tracking
   - Classes: `Sensor`, `AlertManager`, `DataLogger`

2. **Interactive Quiz Buzzer System**
   - Multiple buttons for different players
   - LED feedback and scoring
   - Sound effects with buzzer
   - Classes: `Player`, `QuizGame`, `ScoreBoard`

3. **Plant Care Assistant**
   - Monitor soil moisture and light
   - Alert when watering needed
   - Display care recommendations
   - Classes: `Plant`, `SensorMonitor`, `CareSchedule`

4. **Security System Simulator**
   - Motion detection with light sensor
   - Alarm with buzzer
   - Status display with LEDs
   - Classes: `SecurityZone`, `AlarmSystem`, `EventLogger`

5. **Weather Station Dashboard**
   - Real-time sensor readings
   - Data visualization with LEDs
   - Alert thresholds
   - Classes: `WeatherSensor`, `Dashboard`, `AlertManager`

### Pure Python Project Ideas

1. **Graduation Requirements Tracker**
   - Track completed and remaining courses
   - Monitor progress toward major/minor requirements
   - Calculate credits needed for graduation
   - Generate degree audit reports
   - Classes: `Student`, `Course`, `Requirement`, `DegreeAudit`

2. **Personal Finance Tracker**
   - Track income and expenses
   - Categorize transactions
   - Budget alerts and summaries
   - Classes: `Transaction`, `Account`, `Budget`, `Report`

3. **Text-Based Adventure Game**
   - Multiple rooms/locations
   - Inventory system
   - Puzzles and challenges
   - Classes: `Player`, `Room`, `Item`, `Game`

4. **Study Flashcard App**
   - Create card decks
   - Quiz yourself
   - Track progress
   - Classes: `Flashcard`, `Deck`, `Quiz`, `Progress`

5. **Library Management System**
   - Track books and users
   - Check-in/check-out system
   - Search and recommendations
   - Classes: `Book`, `User`, `Library`, `Transaction`

## Grading Rubric

This activity is assessed on a **pass/fail basis**:

- **1 point**: All three project ideas fully developed with clear descriptions, hardware/team choices, OOP design, and thoughtful reflection
- **0 points**: Fewer than three ideas OR ideas lack sufficient detail (missing key sections)

## Important Notes

- **This is brainstorming only** - you're not committing to these ideas yet
- You can propose any combination of hardware/Python-only ideas
- Think about what you are most excited to learn and build
- The full project requirements will be released next week

## Questions to Consider

As you brainstorm, ask yourself:

- **Motivation:** What problem does this solve? Who would use it?
- **Learning:** What new skills will you practice?
- **Scope:** Can this be completed in the available time?
- **Hardware:** Do you have access to the needed components?
- **Collaboration:** Would this benefit from teamwork?
- **Interest:** Will you stay motivated working on this?
